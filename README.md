A finance manager to keep track of all your finance - fully manually. :)

Enter everything you earn/spend and it will show everything you entered back to you on the web page.

*It does what it is supposed to. More to be added soon. This is just a work in progress.*

# I stopped working on this now. Using [beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/) and [fava](https://beancount.github.io/fava/) these days. And fits most of my needs.  
# I will try to implement my ideas in a port of fava maybe.
